dUET

Here I have tried to recreate the Duet game as far as possible..
You can play the game in this website..
https://bhuvaneshio.github.io/duetthegame

What's Inside the Game:
	1. Controls: A - Anticlockwise()
		     D - Clockwise()
		     P - Pause/Resume
		     R - Reset the Game (Lose the game progress..)
		     'space' - to start the game
	* Remember these controls are not case sensitive..*
	2. The User can see their current score at the top-right corner of the game screen.
	3. The Level of the gameplay depicts the hardness, in other words, the speed at which the blocks are falling through the canvas gets increasing by 1 pixel per framerate per level.
	4. For User's ease the game only starts after the user presses the space bar at the game start screen..
	5. For keeping track of their last scores there is a scoreboard printing all the time the user plays the next game without reset.
	* Remember only the last 10 scores only will get printed..*
	6. For user interface there are lots of images printed inside the canvas
		there is a background image for canvas.
		there is a gameover screen
		there is a reset screen
	7. If u find the A & D controls too easy for you, you can switch to mouseclicks.
	   The click on the left half of canvas  - anticlockwise()
	   The click on the right half of canvas - clockwise()
	8. There are powerups inside the game, for now
	there are two types of powerups
		The first powerup is SPEED, the rabbit stone which signifies it.
		The second powerup is INVINCIBLE, the snake stone signifies it by becoming invisible to the blocks which are incoming.
		But also there is a possiblity that you might get all these two powerups simultaneously. And that is SUPERPOWER
	* Remember that the powerups you collect only last for certain time.. So don't expect any alert *
* Further changes to the game gets inserted here * 
	
Happy Coding..!!
